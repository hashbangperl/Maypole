NAME
    Maypole - MVC web application framework

DESCRIPTION
    Maypole is a Perl framework for MVC-oriented web applications, similar
    to Jakarta's Struts or Ruby on Rails. Maypole is designed to minimize 
    coding requirements for creating simple web interfaces to databases, 
    while remaining flexible enough to support enterprise web applications.

QUICK START
    Maypole ships with a basic demo application, the Beer Database.
    Please see the Maypole manual. You can access the manual by executing the
    following command after installing Maypole:
