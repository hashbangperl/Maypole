2.12/3.0 wishlist
=================

Not for inclusion in the MANIFEST. 

2.11
====
Fix factory roots, document and explain behaviour
send_output() should return a status code
Move template test out of process() and into handler_guts() - maybe
Fix bug 14570 - returning error codes breaks CGI::Maypole
Write Maypole::Manual::Exceptions
Test and refactor external_redirect()

Fix Mp::P::USC. 

2.12
====
Maypole::instance()
Better plugin architecture, for models and bits of models. 
Investigate problems reported with adopt() - rt 15598
Re-implement Maypole::Cache as Maypole::Plugin::Cache, probably using 
    start_request_hook, and not overriding handler_guts()
Handle repeat form submissions.
Implement internal_redirect().
Build a more sophisticated app for testing. 
Move class_of() to the controller - need to do this to support multiple models 
    - maybe
Multiple model support - URLs like /$base/$model/$table/$action/$id.
Refactor M-P-USC and M-P-Session into M-P-User, M-P-Session, and M-P-Cookie


3.0
====
Encapsulate all request data in HTTP::Request object, and all response data 
in HTTP::Response object

Look at HTTP::Body

Easier file uploads - look at incorporating Mp::P::Upload

Add email handling - like Rails - via model plugins. 

An e-commerce model plugin would be nice - or proof of concept - maybe look 
at Handel.  

Add validation layer(s), or just an API

killer apps: SVN model; mitiki; Pet Shop; adventure builder 

Multiple views - HTML, text-only, PDF, SOAP, XML  - use request data to switch
to an alternate view_object - switch via a factory method.

Maybe rename the model to PModel (Presentation Model)?

Pseudo-continuations...
