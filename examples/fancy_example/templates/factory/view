The C<view> template takes some objects (usually just one) from
C<objects> and displays the object's properties in a table.

The C<view> template also displays a list of other objects related to the first
one via C<has_many> style relationships; this is done by calling the
C<related_accessors> method - see L<Model/related_accessors> - to return
a list of has-many accessors. Next it calls each of those accessors, and
displays the results in a table.
